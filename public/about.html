        I'm a college student who dreams to make an impact in engineering research and development.
        I'll be obtaining a BS in Computer Science from UC Santa Barbara in June 2025, and will be
        starting her Masters in Electrical Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University in 
        August 2025. My research interest lies at the intersection between software and hardware
        with a focus on networks, security and architecture.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm heavily involved in the aerospace industry, as I was a 2x software engineering intern 
        for Application Software and Flight Reliability teams at SpaceX, and I'll be returning
        for the Starlink Integration and Test Software team in Summer of 2025. I was also a Test
        and Flight Operations software engineering intern at Blue Origin. In these roles, I was
        worked on critical software that impact the change engineering, supply chain, manufacturing
        and risk assessment workflows throughout the organizations. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Since my freshmen year at UC Santa Barbara, I've been an active undergraduate learning
        assistant for a variety of undergraduate courses ranging from Data Structures and Algorithms, 
        Introduction to Computer Science, Problem Solving, Formal Languages and Automata, and 
        project-based courses. In this role, I held weekly office hours to assist students who
        needed help, and actively participated in teaching team decisions that would maximize the
        quality of student learning. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Curious and adventurous in nature, I've heavily delved into a range of projects, clubs, and
        research initiatives. As a controls software engineer at Gaucho Racing, I work with fellow
        physics, materials, electrical, and mechanical undergraduate engineers to build an electric
        race car for Formula SAE. My main focus is embedded software for the accumulator unit in our
        battery management system of our vehicle. As a research apprentice in the Security Lab, I 
        collaborated with my peers to develop a better framework for understanding and reproducing
        common security vulnerabilities from the MITRE CVE dataset through using Docker containers.
        As an undergraduate research assistant for the Architecture Lab (ArchLab), I work with peers, 
        graduate students, and my professor to study, design and realize a creative solution to
        address the growing energy and time requirements for transferring large-scale datasets within
        a data center. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Looking to the future, I hope to continue exploring the world of engineering through diving
        down the layers of abstraction within computers and electronic devices. In doing so, I'm 
        excited to optimize the speed, efficiency, reliability and security of tomorrow's technology.
